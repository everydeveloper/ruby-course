# Using If Statements for Conditional Execution
Being able to output strings and collect inputs is certainly useful, though being able to check conditions and execute specific code according to those conditions is where the real power of development begins. _If Statements_ allow us the ability to check if something is true, and if that something is true, then a block of code will run. 

To get us started, let's open up the file named *montys-color.rb* in our text editor and we'll create a program similar to our last project. We're going to prompt the user for their favorite color, assign that input to a variable, and then output a string containing the result of that input. 

In lesson three, uncomment lines three, four, and five and then you should have the following:
```ruby
puts "What is your favorite color?"
color = gets.chop
puts "Wow! My favorite color is #{color} also!"
```
If you save the file and run it in the terminal, you'll see that it works like our first project.

But what if your favorite color isn't the same as the program's? What if we want our program to only output that response if the user inputs *blue* as their favorite color? That's where If statements come into play. 

We're going to modify our code to create an If statement that does just that, but first, commit and push the changes you've made to the repo.

With the project backed up, let's create put that output into an If statement. Let's comment out line five by putting the # back onto the front of the code and uncomment lines nine, ten, and eleven in lesson four. You should have the following code:
```ruby
if color == "blue"
    puts "Wow! My favorite color is #{color} also!"
end
```
What's nice about Ruby is that it prioritizes readability because it's written like plain English. This code is saying, "If color is equal to blue, then put "Wow! My favorite color is blue also!" 

If statements evaluate for true or false. If the expression that follows _If_ is true, then it means the condition is met and the code between If and end runs. If the expression is false, the code does not run. 

We use == to check if the two values are equal. Since a single equal sign is used to set a value, we use two equal signs to compare values.

_End_ indicates the end of the If statement. 

If we run this code in the terminal, and enter "blue" in the prompt, we will see our string printed on the screen. If we enter anything else, our string will not print. But what if we want something different to print even when the input isn't "blue?" 

*Commit and push the changes you've made to find out how.*
```console
git add .
git commit -m"add if statement"
git push
```
