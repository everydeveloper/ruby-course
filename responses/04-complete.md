# Explore Ruby on Your Own
Now that you've completed this tutorial, there are plenty more concepts to dive into. 

Here are some suggestions for things you can do to expand on what we learned here today:

* Look into Elsif Statements to create a third branching pathway. For example, if the user inputs "red," make the program respond with something like "It's not as good as blue, but red isn't too bad."
* Look into the `downcase` method and implement it into the project so that no matter what case the user inputs "blue" in, they'll see the expected response.
* Look into Logical Operators to make the program respond with their favorite color being either "blue" or "green."

ðŸŽŠCongratulations! You've written and ran a Ruby program that not only prints strings, but takes user input and prints one of two separate responses depending on that input. Great job and if you are ready to learn more, you can check out the [Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) for more courses.
