# Introduction to Ruby 
## Introduction
In the world of development, there are several programs you are bound to run into time and time again. Programs like "Hello world!", calculators, and to-do lists that are meant to teach core concepts of programming. 

One of those concepts that developers use almost daily is the If Else statement. In plain English, the If Else statement is:

"If a condition is met, then perform this action. Else, perform this different action." 

Understanding how to use If Else statements is a useful tool for any developer to have in their toolbox, and today I'll guide you through the basics with a program I call, "Monty's Color."

Today, I'm going to guide you through learning how to code your first Ruby project. We're going to start by outputting a "Hello world," move on to asking for a users input and outputting something new with that input, and by the end we will have a program that asks us for our favorite color and responds with a unique message only if we answer blue as our favorite color.

Now, before we dive into the tutorial, there are a couple of steps we need to take to set up our work environment.
- [ ] Install Ruby onto our machine
- [ ] Check that Git is installed
- [ ] Clone this project repository onto our machine
- [ ] Install a text editor onto our machine 

*Note:* This tutorial utilizes the command line, so make sure you are familiar with how to use the command line on your machine.

This is an interactive course, where you will be prompted to do something to finish each step.
