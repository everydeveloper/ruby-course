In the world of development, there are several programs you are bound to run into time and time again. Programs like "Hello world!", calculators, and to-do lists that are meant to teach core concepts of programming. 

Today, I'm going to guide you through learning how to code your first Ruby project. We're going to start by outputting a "Hello world," move on to asking for a users input and outputting something new with that input, and by the end we will have a program that asks us for our favorite color and responds with a unique message only if we answer blue as our favorite color.

*Note:* This tutorial utilizes the command line, so make sure you are familiar with how to use the command line on your machine.

This is an interactive course, where you will be prompted to do something to finish each step.
